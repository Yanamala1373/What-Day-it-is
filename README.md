What Day is it?. 

Enhanced Input Validation: Implemented robust input validation to ensure the user enters a valid month (January-December), year (1800-2999), and date within the specified month's range (including leap year considerations).

Modular Design: Organized the code into well-defined functions for clarity, maintainability, and potential reusability (e.g., validmonth, validdate).

Error Handling: Included appropriate exception handling to gracefully address invalid input and provide informative error messages to guide the user.

Leap Year Logic: Accurately accounted for leap years by checking divisibility rules and adjusting calculations accordingly.

Day of Week Calculation: Employed the Zeller's congruence algorithm for efficient and accurate day of the week determination.

Informative Output: Presented the final result as the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) in a clear and user-friendly manner.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Python programming
Input validation and error handling
Date and time manipulation
Algorithm implementation (Zeller's congruence)
User experience design (clear instructions and informative output)
